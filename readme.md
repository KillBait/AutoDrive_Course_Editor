## Start AutoDrive Course Editor
The editor can be started using the supplied CMD file: "Open Editor with Console to see errors.cmd". The editor
can also be started from the command line: java -jar -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m .\AutoDriveEditor.Jar

## Bug Reports

Please use the "Issues" section to report any bugs, i will try to respond as soon as humanly possible, but bear in mind
real life doesn't always allow for quick answers.

## Map Images

I maintain another GitHub repository of map images that the editor uses to automatically download when needed [here](https://github.com/KillBait/AutoDrive_MapImages)

## Map Image Requests

Do you have any map images that are not on the repository?, please consider doing a pull request to add to
the collection, it will help other people.

Help with pull requests can be found on [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

**Not familiar with GitHub.. go over to the [Discussion](https://github.com/KillBait/AutoDrive_MapImages/discussions) section of the map image repository and create a request**
